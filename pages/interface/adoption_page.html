                <h3>Pastor</h3>
                <p>It is a medium-sized dog, white in 
                    color with brown spots. His fur is soft 
                    as silk. It has short and strong legs. 
                    Its ears are small and its snout is slightly
                    flattened. The spot on his chest is in the shape 
                    of a rhombus, this makes him very special. 
                    It wags its tail a thousand times when it greets you.
                    He is very affectionate and I love him very much.</p>
